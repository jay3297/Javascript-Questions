//Write a program that use of all assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=) with a variable.
let num = 10;
num += 5; //output is 10+5=15
num -= 2; //output is 15-2=13
num *= 3; //outut is 13*3=39
num /= 4; //output is 39/4=9.75
num %= 2; //output is 9.75%2=1.75
console.log(num); // so num is 1.75
